1. No commercial spam. This is a political party server. We are not here shopping except for candidates and political campaign items.
2. Be respectful. We are all either Libertarians or guests looking to learn more about the Libertarian Party. Your behavior on this server reflects on the party. Behave accordingly. Also, this is a volunteer organization. Volunteers have a choice how they spend their time and spending their time helping us merits gratitude, not disrespect.
3. Read the room. Do not post the same thing over and over again if it is clear no one is interested. This is not your server for your own personal crusades, it is for coordinating action and educating the public for the LP.
4. Honesty. We try to share accurate information here and hold ourselves to a higher standard of truthfulness and transparency.
5. Use your real name if you need permissions granted for any particular channel or purpose to aid in verifying your identity.

Please pet the :hedgehog: to accept these rules and access the rest of the server.
